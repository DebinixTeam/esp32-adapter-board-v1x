## Fabrication of the board by yourself

This project is open-source, so that you will find KiCad PCB board design files and gerbers in this repository. Therefore, feel free to modify these files to fit your specific need.

You can directly upload files in the fabrication/gerbers folder to a prototype service, such as [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com).
